# Inference of Cell Lineage Tree from scRNA-Seq Data
## Project Description
This project aims to develop a pipeline that reconstructs the phylogenetic tree of cells from single-cell transcriptomic data.
The inferred tree takes the form of a (strictly) binary cell lineage tree, in which each node represents a cell and mutations are attached to edges.


## How to Run the Project
The project in written in Python. To be able to run it, one needs at least the following packages (alphabetical order):
- graphviz
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- scipy

Additionally, one package is required for plotting:
- matplotlib
